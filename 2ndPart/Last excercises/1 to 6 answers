###How would you write a while statement in Go?

	- You only type the condition for the for, and that's it. Syntax example:
		for i < 10 {}


###What does the keyword defer do?

    - Defer waits for the surrounding function to end to run the function call assigned. It puts the execution in a stack (LIFO queue) until the time of execution.


###Does Go support pointers? How do arguments get passed around(by value or by reference)?

    - It does! You can declare it with "var x *int" or "x := &y". Arguments are passed by value by default.


###Are arrays in Go fixed length? How about slices?

    - Arrays are, indeed, fixed length, that's why slices is more used in Golang. Slices length is variable.


###Say you have a map: map[string]int, how would do a lookup and check to see if the map holds the value of the key you were looking for?

    - Implying that the map variable is x and the key is "y", you would only need to type the map and the key to access the value: x["y"].


###How does Go structure programs? What is the difference between a library and a program that executes?

	- from www.go.dev/doc/code:

	  Go programs are organized into packages. A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together. Functions, types, variables, and constants defined in one source file are visible to all other source files within the same package.

	The difference between them is that a package is just a set of tools like functions, methods and variables made for using in an executable program, and that can't be used directly.


###How do make a function or a type public? And how do you make it private?

	- This is rather simple in GO. If the name of the function starts with an upper letter, it's a public function, and if it's lower, it's private.
